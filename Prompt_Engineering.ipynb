This is also the case if you are running these notebooks from a computer whose default AWS credentials have access to Bedrock.\n",

    "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding. The main idea of CoT is that by showing the LLM some few shot exemplars where the reasoning process is explained in the exemplars, the LLM will also show the reasoning process when answering the prompt. This explanation of reasoning often leads to more accurate results."
